Android wearable Examples for v1.3.0
========

While all this examples are v2.0.0 ready, meaning that have wear2.0.0 set, they can changed back to v1.3.0.  Since the new support wear and depricated api that
now show in v2.1.x+ I'm leaving the orignal examples here.

<b>myWatchFace</b> several examples of watch faces for the wear device.  V1.3.0 now.  Will work in v2.0.0, but some methods are depricated. 

<b>TapEventsDemo</b> a simple watchface to demo the tapevents added in wear 1.3.0 (setup for v2.0.0 now)

<b>WearApp</b> is an app to run the watch, that has a button to show a random number.  Uses a StudView to display round/square  (wear v2.0.0 ready)

<b>WearAppv23</b> is an app to run the watch, that has a button to show a random number.  Uses a layout-round layout-notround (for v23+) to display round/square.  (wear v2.0.0 ready)

<b>WearableDataLayer</b> is an example of how send messages back and forth between the wear app and a phone app using the data layer in google-playservices.  You will need to install the wear app on to the wear device.  Install the mobile app on the phone/tablet device that is connected to the wear device.  Tested in wear 1.3.0 and wear 2.0.0 as well.
